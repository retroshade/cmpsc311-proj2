II - Description
=======================================================================================
wordc-mp.c 

The main program, wordc-mp, is used to read a file. The program then takes the file and 
breaks it up into n number of sections (determined by the user at runtime). The program 
then creates a pipe, along with (n - 1) child processes. Each of these processes, along 
with the parent process, will run it's own mini-sort. This is a sort of the subset of 
words in each section. After counting and sorting all the words within the mini-sort, 
the child processes will pipe back into the parent process. The parent process will take
all of these inputs from the pipes and sort them back in with its own mini-sort and 
adding the amounts of each word from each child process to the amount in its own 
mini-sort, creating one large sorted and counted file.

wordc-mp.h 

This file contains all of the library files needed, along with any and all function 
prototypes. In the file, the list list struct is defined, which contains elements for 
each word, the amount of instances of that word. The file also defines a boolean type 
that is used when searching through the linked list to see if there is already an 
instance of any particular word within that list.

III - Difficulties, etc.
=======================================================================================
One of the hardest things, which we could have expected, was creating and using the 
pipes. This difficulty mainly arose because we have never used them before. We also ran 
into som trouble when piping the final word of the text file back into the parent 
process. When we initially ran the tests, the last word was being counted a seemingly
random amount of extra times. At one point, the last word was being "sorted" and 
counted 5 extra times. Another, 6 extra times.

IV - System Calls and Library Functions
=======================================================================================
malloc(), close(), fopen(), getpid(), fork(), read(), write(), clock(), atoi(), 
perror(), fgetc(), isalpha(), tolower(), printf(), pipe(), rewind(), exit(), fclose(),
strcmp(), fprintf()
=======================================================================================

V - Design Choices
=======================================================================================
We decided that we would keep the linked list, since it made the most sense in terms of 
implementation. We also opted to break the adding of elements to the linked list into 
multiple different functions, in order to account for the first elemnt in the list, any 
element throughout the list, and the final element. We decided to implement the file 
descriptors as 2D arrays. This allowed us to have a specific set for each child.
