  -denotes degree of concurrency (number of processes)
if more than 1 process, then program must make extra processes using fork()
each of n processes will cary out word counting over 1/n words/bytes, while respecting word boundaries
  -read file, get wordcount
  -each section will contain wordcount/n words
Parent must create n-1 pipes using pipe()
  -1 for reading infor from each of its children
  -must convey range of words that child is supposed to count
  -each child must carry out word counting for its section of words
  -pass its output to parent (using appropriate pipe())
  -parent must merge outcomes of its own "mini-wc" with its children's outputs to create final output
    -will write to file
Each child should indicate to parent that it has finished it mini-wc via signal (kill()) that parent must implement signal handler for
